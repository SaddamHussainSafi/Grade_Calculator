# Grade Calculator

This is a simple web-based **Grade Calculator** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to add activities (like assignments or tests), assign weights, and input grades. The interface dynamically updates a table to show all activities and their corresponding grades.

## 🚀 Features

- Add activities with custom weight
- Assign grades to specific activities
- Delete the last or a specific activity
- Error handling for invalid inputs

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML for structure
- CSS for basic styling
- JavaScript for interactivity and logic

## 🧩 How It Works

1. Enter an activity name and its weight, then click **"Add Activity"**.
2. Enter a grade and the activity number to assign a grade using **"Add Grade"**.
3. You can also delete the last activity or a specific one.

## 📌 Notes

- Some portions of the JavaScript logic and layout structure were inspired by or adapted from tutorials and relevant educational coding resources found online.
- The code was refined and customized for better clarity and functionality.
